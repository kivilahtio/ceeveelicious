8h - Choosing the back-end systems to use. Comparing build/deployment options, like Docker, Vagrant.
     Docker seemed the most easiest to deploy.
     Carton is a great tool for deploying pureperl modules.
     Mojolicious is pure awesomeness!
     Swagger2.0 is a great API definition language!
     Deployed the basic web-server infrastructure and carton/docker build scripts.
     Implemented the Swagger2 API for "stories".

1h - Decided to use ElasticSearch as the persistence storage over MongoDB. Studying ElasticSearch model definitions.

2h - Realized ES is too big to deploy as a simple CV, so reverting to a pureperl easy-to-deploy DBM::Deep.
     Writing DB accessor code.

4h - Managed to make a semi-intelligent DB system. Created a lean installer to populate default objects.
     Improved the Docker script to work with new dependencies. Wrote REST API tests. Fixed AssetPack bug.
     Looking good to start writing the front-end.
